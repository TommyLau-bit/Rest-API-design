Goal

The COMP0035 Coursework 1 involves creating two data science web applications, focusing on software development and data preparation skills. It assesses your ability to select and apply relevant techniques throughout a project lifecycle.

Key Objectives

	1.	Data Preparation & Understanding: Develop code for data preparation and exploration using pandas and matplotlib.
	2.	Project & Product Definition: Define the purpose, target audience, and goals for two applications:
    	•	App1: REST API for data access, aimed at developers.
    	•	App2: A data-driven web app using the API (options include a dashboard, ML model, or other data-based functionalities).
	3.	Tools & Techniques: Demonstrate effective use of GitHub for version control and optional AI for data prep code.
	4.	Methodology (Groups Only): Select and justify a suitable project methodology.

Structure

	•	Work Individually or in Groups: Choice impacts project aspects and requirements. Data sets are allocated accordingly.
	•	Technologies: Primarily pandas, matplotlib, and GitHub for code control. Markdown or PDF is recommended for documentation.

Deliverables

	1.	Data Preparation:
    	•	data.py: Code for data prep.
    	•	dataset.csv and dataset_prepared.csv: Original and processed datasets.
    	•	Explanation of data prep steps.
	2.	Project Definition (coursework1.pdf/md):
    	•	Problem statement and product overview.
    	•	Persona definition for target audience.
    	•	SMART goals or questions for App2.
	3.	Tools & Techniques:
    	•	Source code control usage (GitHub URL).
    	•	Linting (Groups Only).
    	•	Project planning (Groups Only).
    	•	Explanation of AI usage if applied.
