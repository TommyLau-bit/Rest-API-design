# Data preparation and understanding code
# Option 1: Load .csv file into a pandas dataframe variable and skip the first line which is blank
# Print the first 5 rows of data
# Print the last 3 rows of data
# Print the column labels
# Print the column labels and data types
# Describe the data using statistical information
# set the display to the size of the original dataframe
# Remove unnecessary columns
#Remove the column 'Request Received (Quarter)' because it can be referred by the (month) column
#Remove the column 'Request Closed (Quarter)', (same reason as above)
#Merging data is not required for this dataset as all information is sufficient
#Based on the provided dataset, it appears that there are no explicit missing values or NaN entries.
#Identifying null values
#The following code is to see a count of None and NaN values in each column
#isna() to select all rows with NaN in an entire DataFrame:
#Drop null values and replace null values
#Handling inconsistent values 
#no unique values 
#finding and dropping duplicates
#Remove blank spaces
#No classified data
#Check the data types of columns 
#Simplify and clean up table
# Save the DataFrame back to a new csv. 
#Exploring and understanding the data
#Create a boxplot for 'Case Active Days at Closure' because it has the most randomised data out of the other columns 
#No need to drop or remove any of the outliers because the data is already quite spread out
#create a Histogram for 'Case Active Days at Closure'
#Code challenges
#Check for outliers in other columns 
#Create a bocplot for the column 'Number of Records'
#From the boxplot we can see that there is no outliers identified as all the numbers are at 1
#Create a histogram for other columns 
#Create a histogram for the column 'Number of Records'
#Create a histogram for the column 'Request Received (year)'
#Create a histogram for the column 'Request Received (Month)'
#Create a bar chart
# Filter data for the month of May
# Create a bar chart
